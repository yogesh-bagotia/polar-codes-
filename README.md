# Polar Codes – Communication Systems Project

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of **Polar Codes**, developed as part of the *Introduction to Communication Systems (CT-216)* course project. Polar codes are the first class of error-correcting codes proven to achieve Shannon capacity for a wide class of communication channels with efficient encoding and decoding.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project explores:

* Theoretical foundations of Polar Codes
* Channel polarization and its proof
* Construction and decoding techniques
* Performance analysis through MATLAB simulations

## 📊 Simulation Results

Simulations were carried out in MATLAB using:

* Block lengths up to 256
* Rates: 0.25, 0.5, 0.625
* SC and SCL decoders

Key highlights:

* SCL decoding significantly improves reliability over SC
* Polar Codes approach theoretical limits under high SNR
* CRC enhances error detection in SCL decoding

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* **Polarization**: Using recursive transforms to convert channels into either nearly perfect or completely noisy.
* **Channel Capacity**: Achieving reliable transmission close to Shannon's theoretical limit.
* **Trade-offs**: Between complexity, code rate, and performance for SC vs SCL.
